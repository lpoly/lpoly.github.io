        <p><strong>Brief:</strong> This project focuses on optimizing the trajectory of a robotic arm in both 2D and 3D space. By leveraging forward kinematics and gradient-based optimization, the goal is to guide the arm‚Äôs end-effector toward a target point with minimal error. Implemented in Python, the system models joint behavior and applies numerical techniques to find optimal joint angles through simulation and cost minimization.</p>
    
        <h3>Details</h3>

        <p>
          In the 2D setup, we modeled a two-link robotic arm where the position of the end-effector was derived using forward kinematics. The goal was to minimize the Euclidean distance between the arm's hand and a desired target point by adjusting the joint angles using gradient-based optimization. We derived and implemented analytical gradients of the cost function with respect to each joint angle.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the 3D extension, the robotic arm consists of three segments, each represented by two angles: azimuth (Œ∏) and elevation (œï). The arm's movement was modeled using <strong>spherical coordinates</strong> to capture the spatial orientation of each joint. This allowed for smooth and realistic simulation of the arm's trajectory in three dimensions.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key challenge was determining the optimal step size during gradient descent. To address this, we implemented the <strong>Armijo backtracking line search</strong> method. This approach dynamically adjusts the step size based on a sufficient decrease condition, ensuring fast convergence while preventing overshooting and oscillations of the arm.
        </p>

        <p>
          For visualizing the movement and optimization process, we used <strong>VPython</strong> to animate the robotic arm in 3D space. This provided an intuitive representation of how the arm adjusts its joints in real-time to reach the target, making the results both interpretable and visually engaging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the optimization techniques tested, <strong>Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAGD)</strong> consistently outperformed traditional Gradient Descent in both speed and convergence quality. The results were verified using numerical metrics and visual animation.
